<div align="center"><h1> About COS212 </h1></div>

COS 212 follows the textbook
> Data Structures and Algorithms In Java
> by Adam Drozdek 4th Edition

The book covers data structures such as Linked Lists, Binary trees, MultiWay Trees and Graphs. The book also covers how
programming techniques like recursion and OOP (Object Orientated Programing) in java can be used to, traverse and build
the data structures. And finally the book also looks at popular sorting and hashing algorithms.

## 212 Structure

COS212 is set up as a continuous assessment module, meaning once you have 50% you pass, the module is split up as
follows

|  | Number | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exam Opportunities | 3 | 60 |
| Pracs | 11 (best 10 count) | 10 |
| Tutorials | 11 (best 10 count) | 10 |
| Assignments | 4 | 20 |

With 3 exams each counting 20%, 10 pracs counting 1%, 10 Tutorials counting 1% and 4 Assignments each counting 5%.
Generally speaking the assignments will be given to be completed over the course of 2-3 weeks while pracs will be
evaluated within 1-2 days.

## Languages and Tools

The course will be taught in the programing language Java vs1.8, but learners will be restricted to using OOP design
patterns to create data structures for the practical component of the course. Simple implementation aspects will likely
be asked in the Tutorials and Exams as well, ie code the add method for a Binary Tree (3 marks). </br>
I will be using the IntellijIdea IDE, for it's superior debugger and code completion functionality compared to most
standard IDE's, and text editors.  </br>
I highly recommend that students download and make use of this IDE as it will dramatically help them with their coding
experience, They can follow this link to see how to download and set up the IDE for Windows and Linux platforms.
