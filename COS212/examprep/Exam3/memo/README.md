## Question 1: [Spanning Trees](https://gitlab.com/Paul_Wood_96/tutoring/-/tree/master/COS212/notes/GraphsPart5)

For all questions that follow assume the following Graph. During traversal if at any point you must make a choice of
where to move next chose the next vertex alphabetically.

![img.png](../images/spanning_tree.png)

1.1) Using Kruskal's eager Algorithm identify the list of edges that will be part of the spanning tree. Only identify
the list of edges that will be part of the resulting spanning tree in the format AB, AC, AD in the case of edges between
AB, AC and AD being a part of the spanning tree.

1.2) For each of the following statements indicate whether the provided statement is true or false, provide a reason for
your answer:

1.2.1)

```text
Dijkstra's Spanning Tree Algorithm will never look at every edge within the graph before terminating.

```

```text
FALSE: Dijkstra's algorithm is lazy (does not sort the edges before traversal) and will look at every edge within the graph and ensure to remove the greatest edge in a cycle once 
it is detected.
```

1.2.2)

```text
Kruskal Algorithm has the potential to look at every edge within the graph
```

```text
TRUE: The stopping condition for Kruskal algorithm is; when the number of edges added in the spanning tree is 
equal to 1 less than the number of vertices in the graph. This is not a condition that will always result in fewer 
iterations than edges. A scenario in which the greatest value edge is the only path to a Vertex will result in 
a situation where every edge will being visited when applying Kruskals algorithm. 
```

1.2.3)

```text
In Dijkstra's algorithm complexity is added in determining the lowest values in cycles
```

```text
TRUE: When detecting a cycle within the spanning tree, the edges which make up that cycle will have to be sorted 
in order to remove the largest weighted edge and keep the lowest weighted edges. Sorting algorithms can add 
complexity to the algorithm. 
```

## Question 3: [Sorting](https://gitlab.com/Paul_Wood_96/tutoring/-/blob/master/COS212/notes/Sorting/README.md)

3.1) Insertion sort works by intuitively sorting a list, placing elements in order at each iteration. The algorithm is
made up using a combination of an inner and outer loop. The outer loop iterates through the elements in the list from
left to right, the inner loop sorts the array up until the counter of the outer loop selecting the element to place at
each index.

Implement a recursive implementation of the insertion sort outer loop which will created a sorted. Your implementation
should explore the elements going from the back of the list first.

```java
public class Sorting {

    public int[] insert(int[] unsortedArray, int index) {

        int[] sortedArray;

        // base case, return the sorted array with the last element
        if (index == unsortedArray.length - 1) {
            sortedArray = new int[unsortedArray.length];
            sortedArray[index] = unsortedArray[index];
            return sortedArray;
        }

        int[] partiallySortedArray = insert(unsortedArray, index + 1); // holds the sorted list from the last iteration
        sortedArray = new int[unsortedArray.length]; // empty list

        int newValue = unsortedArray[index]; // the new value we want to add in at this recursive call
        int lastIndex = partiallySortedArray.length - 1;
        boolean added = false;


        // loop through partially sorted array which starts at one index higher than current index
        for (int i = index + 1; i <= lastIndex; ) {

            if (!added && newValue < partiallySortedArray[i]) {
                sortedArray[index++] = newValue;
                added = true;
            } else {
                sortedArray[index++] = partiallySortedArray[i++];
            }
        }

        if (!added) {
            sortedArray[lastIndex] = newValue;
        }

        return sortedArray;
    }
}

```

## Question 4: [Hashing](https://gitlab.com/Paul_Wood_96/tutoring/-/blob/master/COS212/notes/Hashing/README.md)

Assume the following data:

```text
122    14    16    17    5     8     35    27    13    3
``` 

Assume that Coalesced Hashing with a cellar was being applied to the data above using the following Hash function:
`H(K) = 2k % 7 + 3`.

4.1.1) Assume the following table where each row indicates the fields value and coalesced pointer. Insert the data and
indicate the pointer values for each collision you encounter, in the case of multiple collision you should make use of
Linear Probing. The cellar starts at index 8

<img src="../images/hashing_answer.png" alt="hashing answer" width="30%">

4.1.2) Assume the element 8 was deleted, describe the steps needed to perform this operation

```text
The element 8 would be deleted and no further action would be needed
```

4.1.3) Assume element 35 was deleted, show the table after this operation has been performed

```text
We can remove the element 35 from the table data and leave its Coalesced pointer, to the 
next element in the list, for the time being we can mark the data as removed but handle its deletion 
in the case of another new collision. 
```

## Question 4.2: [Hashing Cichelliâ€™s](https://gitlab.com/Paul_Wood_96/tutoring/-/blob/master/COS212/notes/Cichellis/README.md)

Given the following words, in no particular order.

> January February March April May June July

4.2.1) Perform Cichelli's algorithm to perfectly hash the following words into a table. for each greek letter indicate
the correct response

![img.png](../images/cichillis_first_steps.png)

|  |  |
| --- | ---|
| 0 | January |
| 1 | February |
| 2 | April |
| 3 | May |
| 4 | July |
| 5 | vi |

[img.png](../images/cichillis_result.png)

4.2.2) Give the offset values for each letter used after applying Cichelli's algorithm

| Letter | Offset |
| --- | ---|
| y | 0 |
| J | 0 |
| M | 0 |
| F | 0 |
| A | 1 |
| L | 3 |
| E | 1 |

## Question 5: [Encoding](https://gitlab.com/Paul_Wood_96/tutoring/-/blob/master/COS212/notes/Encoding/README.md)

5.1) Assume the following string needed to be encoded in a way that would best make use of memory, while still being
able to be decoded.

> Sassy Susy sells seashells

.1) Which encoding algorithm would be best suited to encode this string and why?

```text
Adaptive huffman, because you do not know the frequency of each character before hand. The adaptive, 
huffman could dynamically map the encoded strings as it counts the frequency of each character encountered.
```

.2) Name a few disadvantages of Adaptive Huffman over regular Huffman

```text
* More complex decoding algorithms 
* You have to store the Huffman Tree as well, whereas regular Huffman could be calculated on each iteration. 
```

5.2.1) Assume the following records were kept, which tracked the recorded percentages of rain fall in each month of a
given year. You may assume that no rain fell in months that are not recorded. You are required to encode this data using
Huffman encoding please provide the Huffman tree once you have finished applying the algorithm

|January | February | June | September |October | November | December |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.17 | 0.12 | 0.02 | 0.25 | 0.11 | 0.11 | 0.22 |

| 110 | 010 | 1111 | 10 | 011 | 110 | 00 |

5.3)

The adaptive huffman is an extension to the regular Huffman tree which does not require the probability of each value to
be known beforehand. Assume the following string

> abeebac

Please apply the adaptive huffman to the input string above **NB** please read all questions first before moving on from
this point, you may assume the following alphabet node
