<h1> About 110

COS 110 is the continuation to the module 132, an introduction to c++. The module 
follows the text book:
> Starting Out With C++ From Control Structures through 
> Objects: Eight Edition by Tony Gaddis 




COS 110 starts at Chapter 13 an *Introduction to Classes* and continues till 
chapter 18 *Stacks and Queues*. I cover examples throughout the textbok as well 
as my own to try and guide learners to a better understanding of concepts as 
well as the pracical understanding of the language.
