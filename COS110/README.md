<div align="center"><h1> About 110 </h1></div>

COS 110 is the continuation to the module 132, an introduction to c++. The module 
follows the text book:
> Starting Out With C++ From Control Structures through 
> Objects: Eight Edition by Tony Gaddis 




COS 110 starts at Chapter 13 an *Introduction to Classes* and continues till 
chapter 18 *Stacks and Queues*. I cover examples throughout the textbok as well 
as my own to try and guide learners to a better understanding of concepts as 
well as the pracical understanding of the language.

This Repo also contains code examples, that we have gone through in class or that 
were mentioned in the notes. The IDE we use to code is called [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/promo/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIz-LMtJjZ5wIVyfZRCh1x4A23EAAYASAAEgIWYvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
It is a bit complex to follow you can use the following tutorial to help you set up 
your CLion environment: [CLion set-up]()
